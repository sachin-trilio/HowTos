# Multiple Namespaces Backup and Restore
TrilioVault for Kubernetes supports backup and restore of multiple namespaces from a kubernetes cluster. The user at times needs to protect more than 1 namespace. This feature helps the user to create a backup plan for multiple namespaces. The backus can be scheduled or created on demand. This feature also makes it easy for the user to restore some or all of the namespaces that are backed up. 

## Steps to create multiple namespaces backup

1. Log in to the **Management Console** of _Triliovault for Kubernetes_. 
2. The **Cluster Management** (Home) tab is displayed by default, which displays a list of TV-enabled clusters.
